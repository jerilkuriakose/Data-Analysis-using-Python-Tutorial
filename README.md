# About the tutorial
This tutorial focuses on Big Data and how to analyse the Big Data. This tutorial is divided in two two parts, in the first part we will learning how to use Hadoop for performing the map-reduce operation on the large dataset. The software installation steps for the first part of the tutorial can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0zGBZ6EHap-Smsr3x3sGGpDW-54m82kDpPKC2M6uiY/pub).

In the second part we will be focussing on Data Analysis using Python. We will be using the *pandas* library for performing the analysis. To perform classification and clustering we will be using the *sklearn* library. We will using *Jupyter notebook* as our IDE. The software installation steps of part 2 can be found here.
